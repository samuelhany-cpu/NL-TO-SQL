EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
----------------------------------------
Total Tests: 20
Success Rate: 0.0%
Status: ❌ CRITICAL - Parser not handling basic natural language

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
----------------------------------------
1. GRAMMAR LIMITATIONS:
   • Current grammar expects very specific patterns
   • Missing support for 'Show me' pattern (has 'Show all' only)
   • Limited vocabulary for natural language expressions
   • No flexibility for word variations or synonyms

2. LEXER ISSUES:
   • Lexer has required tokens (SHOW, ME, ALL, PRODUCTS)
   • But grammar rules don't combine them properly
   • Missing rules for common NL patterns

3. PARSER ARCHITECTURE:
   • Parser expects SQL-like structure in natural language
   • No semantic understanding or intent recognition
   • No fallback mechanisms for unrecognized patterns

CURRENT WORKING PATTERNS
----------------------------------------
Based on grammar analysis, these patterns SHOULD work:
✓ 'Show all products'
✓ 'List all products'
✓ 'What products are available'
✓ 'How many phones'
✓ 'How many laptops we have'
✓ 'Show available products'

FAILED PATTERNS (What We Tested)
----------------------------------------
❌ 'Show me all products'
   Expected: SELECT * FROM products
   Error: Could not parse query: Show me all products

❌ 'Show me all users where age is greater than 25'
   Expected: SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 25
   Error: Could not parse query: Show me all users where age is greater than 25

❌ 'Show me the name and email from users'
   Expected: SELECT name, email FROM users
   Error: Could not parse query: Show me the name and email from users

❌ 'Show me all products ordered by price'
   Expected: SELECT * FROM products ORDER BY price
   Error: Could not parse query: Show me all products ordered by price

❌ 'Show me the first 10 users'
   Expected: SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 10
   Error: Could not parse query: Show me the first 10 users

❌ 'Show me all orders with customer names'
   Expected: SELECT orders.*, customers.name FROM orders JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.id
   Error: Could not parse query: Show me all orders with customer names

❌ 'Count the number of orders per customer'
   Expected: SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) FROM orders GROUP BY customer_id
   Error: Could not parse query: Count the number of orders per customer

❌ 'Show me products where price is between 100 and 500 and category is electronics'
   Expected: SELECT * FROM products WHERE price BETWEEN 100 AND 500 AND category = "electronics"
   Error: Could not parse query: Show me products where price is between 100 and 500 and category is electronics

❌ 'What is the average price of all products'
   Expected: SELECT AVG(price) FROM products
   Error: Could not parse query: What is the average price of all products

❌ 'Show me customers who have more than 5 orders'
   Expected: SELECT customer_id FROM orders GROUP BY customer_id HAVING COUNT(*) > 5
   Error: Could not parse query: Show me customers who have more than 5 orders

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT
----------------------------------------
🔧 IMMEDIATE FIXES:
1. Add grammar rules for 'SHOW ME' patterns
2. Add support for 'WHERE' conditions in natural language
3. Add table name recognition (users, products, orders)
4. Add column name recognition (name, email, age, price)

🚀 ARCHITECTURE IMPROVEMENTS:
1. Implement semantic parsing with intent recognition
2. Add machine learning-based NL understanding
3. Create entity recognition for tables/columns
4. Add query template matching
5. Implement fuzzy matching for similar patterns

💡 ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES:
1. Use transformer models (BERT, T5) for sequence-to-sequence
2. Implement rule-based templates with pattern matching
3. Add database schema integration for context
4. Create a hybrid approach: rules + ML

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
----------------------------------------
Phase 1 - Quick Fixes (1-2 days):
• Extend grammar rules for common patterns
• Add missing token combinations
• Create basic template matching

Phase 2 - Enhanced NL Support (1 week):
• Implement semantic role labeling
• Add entity recognition
• Create query intent classification

Phase 3 - ML Integration (2-3 weeks):
• Train sequence-to-sequence models
• Implement transformer-based parsing
• Add continuous learning capabilities

SUGGESTED TEST CASES FOR CURRENT GRAMMAR
----------------------------------------
📝 'Show all products'
📝 'List all products'
📝 'What products are available'
📝 'How many phones'
📝 'How many laptops we have'
📝 'Show available products'
📝 'How many units of phones in store'
📝 'What is available'
📝 'Show low stock'
📝 'List all items'

These should work with the current grammar implementation.

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
----------------------------------------
Average Processing Time: 2.06ms
Fastest Query: 0.11ms
Slowest Query: 9.28ms

CONCLUSION
----------------------------------------
The current NL-to-SQL parser is in early development stage.
It requires significant enhancement to handle real-world queries.
Immediate focus should be on expanding grammar rules and
implementing more flexible pattern matching.
